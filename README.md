## Advanced and Mechanical Mates
#### Included Files:
Advanced_and_Mechanical_Mates.SLDASM <br />
Advanced_and_Mechanical_Mates_1.SLDPRT <br />
Pin.SLDPRT <br />

In this assignment I made a linear extender that is controlled with a pin. The body of the extender is made of three different versions of the same part. This assignment taught me how to use advanced mates in assemblies to make a more dynamic and functional CAD prototype.

## Design Tables
#### Included Files:
Design_Tables.SLDPRT <br />

For this assignment I made a "spool thingy" that has different configurations that allow you to make it in different sizes without having to recreate the whole part. In this I learned how using design tables can be much more efficient than redesigning a part from scratch.
