### Advanced and Mechanical Mates Assembly:
Advanced_and_Mechanical_Mates.SLDASM <br /> 
<br />
For this assignment I mated all of the parts together with advanced mates that allowed them to move. This created a linear extender.<br />
This assignment taught me how to use Solidworks assemblies to make a more dynamic prototype.<br />
